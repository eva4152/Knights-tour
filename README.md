# Knights-tour
This program follows a knights trip around a chessboard. Based on the startposition, the knight will show the maximum trips the knight can made based of the greedy-algoritm. Which take the first avaible trip it can. 
The program is firstly made of two array, that contains the trips the knight can make, divided by the x- and y-scale. The board is also declared into a 2d board, which size 8x8. Moreover the program is made of a couple of functions. Where the first one first_move() finds the first possible move the knight can make, which is inside the board and not at a place is has beeen before. If its not possible, it will return -1. The next function generate_board(), generate the board visually, where the startposition is marked with xx. And all the places the knight have been is marked with the tour number the knight piece is at. and lastly it will print -- at the remaining pieces.
The next function make_a_move(), each x and y coordinates will get added with the first_move() number until its not possible to make another move. And the board will be printed each time to show the trip.
In the main function, we ask the user for the start coordinates, which we put in the command-line interface in make_a_move() function.
